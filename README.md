# Signature And Log Analysis With Suricata
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of the components of rules within Suricata. We also demonstrate triggering a new rule and examining the output in Suricata by using a Bash shell. <br />

Objectives:
  - Examine a rule in Suricata.
  - Trigger a rule and review the alert logs.
  - Examine 'eve.json' outputs.

<h2>Examining a Custom Rule in Suricata</h2>
In this step, we explore the current composition of the Suricata rule defined in the "custom.rules" file.

  - The action is the first part of the signature. It determines the action to take if all conditions are met.
  - The next part of the signature is the header. The header defines the signatureâ€™s network traffic, which includes attributes such as protocols, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and traffic direction.
  - The following section, rule options, allow you to customize signatures with additional parameters.

<h2>Triggering a Custom Rule in Suricata</h2>
In this section, we'll trigger a custom Suricata rule and examine the alert logs that Suricata generates. <br />

  - Run Suricata and list files in /var/log/suricata folder:

Note that there are a total of 4 files with the same "read, write, & execute" permissions for file owners, group owners, and other users.

  - Use the 'cat' command to display the fast.log file generated by Suricata:

<h2>Examine eve.json Output</h2>
In this section, we examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the eve.json file. <br />

  - Use 'cat' command to display entries in the eve.json file:

Note that there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

  - Use 'jq' command to display entries in an improved format:

Note that you must exit the 'less' command using "Q" to return to command-line prompt.

  - Use 'jq' command to extract specific event data from eve.json file:

  - Use 'jq' command to display all event logs related to a specific flow_id from the eve.json file:
